# NinjArmy

**NinjArmy** is an open-source, local-first platform for orchestrating multiple AI coding agents. Think *vibe coding*, but more structured. You can ideate, hire specialized agents, watch them work in parallel, and merge their results into real code.

This project is built for developers who want **more leverage, less chaos**, and full control over their tools.

---

NinjArmy lets you:

* Ideate with a **Manager AI** that maintains global context
* Spawn multiple **specialized agents** (Tester, Optimizer, Brute Force, etc.)
* Choose **which model** powers each agent (GPT, Claude, local LLMs)
* Run agents **simultaneously**, not sequentially
* Route *all* agent output through the manager for synthesis and decisions
* Apply changes to real repositories with diffs, tests, and summaries

All of this runs **locally by default**. You bring your own API keys. No cloud lock-in.

#### MVP

* CLI-based manager
* YAML-defined agents
* Parallel agent execution
* Git repo awareness

#### Future

* Web UI with live agent monitoring
* Prompt linting and refinement
* Agent templates and community sharing
* Plugin system
* Local LLM support out of the box

**Early-stage / actively designed**

APIs, prompts, and architecture are still in progress.
